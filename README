Posterous-Redirect
------------------
I created this script after transferring my Wordpress blog to Posterous, all my old links were broken and I didn't want to lose any traffic.
This script will 301 (permanently) redirect all old posts/tags/categories to the relevant page on your new Posterous account.
See the script itself for a full readme/usage.
